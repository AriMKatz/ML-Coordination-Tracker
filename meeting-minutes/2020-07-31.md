# Notes on 31 July 2020

## Agenda:
- State of DataLoader and Dataset in FastAI.jl
    - What about Flux.DataLoader is missing?
- PR to MLDatasets.jl to make datasets iteratable/map-like
    - Already iterable but it would be better to extend Base (currently uses custom `traintensor` function)
- State of transforms
- Should we put together an example gist for the ML call?
- Discussion on side-effects in Python code

## Minutes
- Flux.DataLoader missing a lot features from [this list](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/ML-Coordination-Tracker/issues/5)
- https://github.com/lorenzoh/DataLoaders.jl has a lot of the features we need
    - Author is not responsive
    - We could still use this package for inspiration
- Can we compose with [Dagger.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/Dagger.jl) and [Transducers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds/Transducers.jl)
    - Dagger, yes
    - Transducers.jl will require implementing a larger set of interface
    - Might need to implement [SplittablesBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds/SplittablesBase.jl)
- Start a repo for DataLoaders and get vanilla up and running
    - In parallel branch work on Transducers.jl etc.
    - Try to get vanilla example up and running with FastAI.jl
- Support for fancy indexing
    - Probably an easy refactor once the community settles on a package
    - Will need Flux.jl to support fancy indexing first
- Transformers design is complicated by weird FastAI type hierarchy/abstractions
    - OK to be more "pythonic" at first
    - Julia implementations will leverage existing packages
    - Take shortcuts through the abstraction when possible
    - Open issue on tracker to get feedback from community on design decisions
- Meeting time
    - Reschedule according to new poll
    - Try to get everyone this time
    - Settle on regular meeting time
