# Notes on 31 July 2020

## Agenda:
- State of DataLoader and Dataset in FastAI.jl
    - What about Flux.DataLoader is missing?
- PR to MLDatasets.jl to make datasets iteratable/map-like
    - Already iterable but it would be better to extend Base (currently uses custom `traintensor` function)
- State of transforms
- Should we put together an example gist for the ML call?
- Discussion on side-effects in Python code
