# Notes on 8 September 2020

## Agenda:
- Mutable state and the `Learner`
    - What constitutes state? When does it need to be mutated?
      | State                | Example of mutation                          |
      |:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
      | Model (architecture) | Pruning methods                              |
      | Model (parameters)   | Pruning methods, weight clipping             |
      | Data                 | Adversarial training                         |
      | Optimizer            | Hyperparameter tuning                        |
      | Augmentation Flow    | Hyperparameter tuning                        |
    - Prevent multiple callbacks from overriding each other
        - Does functional programming prevent this?
    - Designing the callback system as a series of transforms
    - What is misuse of an API? Used in a way that violates assumptions?
- Parallel training
- Triage system
