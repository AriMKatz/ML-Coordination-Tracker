# Julia Community ML Ecosystem Coordination

Find us on Zulip: https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#streams/237432/ml-ecosystem-coordination

This is still very much a work in progress! For a list of ideas and action points, see the [general issues project](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/ML-Coordination-Tracker/projects/5). More specific projects can be found under the Projects tab.

Many of our contributions might be spread across several repos, so if you want to get involved and don't know where to start, you should ping us on Zulip. Or if you see that someone is assigned to a specific issue, you can DM them on Zulip.
